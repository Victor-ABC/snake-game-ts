# Snake Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classical Snake game using native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a fun and nostalgic gaming experience, allowing users to control a snake as it moves around the game board, eating food and growing longer.

## Features

- Responsive design: The game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Simple controls: Use arrow keys or swipe gestures to control the direction of the snake.
- Score tracking: Keep track of your score as you eat food and grow longer.
- Game over detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
4. Alternatively, if you're on a mobile device, swipe in the direction you want the snake to move.
5. Eat the food items (represented by red dots) to grow longer and increase your score.
6. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself.
7. The game ends when the snake collides, and you can restart by refreshing the page.
